## Pulling and Running the Project on a New Computer

When pulling the project repository to a new computer, follow these steps to ensure that all functions, including registration, login, and CRUD operations, work correctly.

### 1. Version Control (Git) Setup

- **Ensure All Files Are Committed and Pushed**: Before pulling the repository to another computer, make sure that all files are committed and pushed to your remote repository. This includes:
  - `Controllers`
  - `Views`
  - `Models`
  - `wwwroot` (CSS, JavaScript, images)
  - `appsettings.json`
  - `Program.cs` and `Startup.cs` (if using .NET Core 3.x or earlier)
  - `.gitignore` (to avoid committing unnecessary files)

### 2. Pulling the Repository

- **Clone or Pull the Repository**: On the new computer, clone the repository or pull the latest changes from the remote repository.

  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
